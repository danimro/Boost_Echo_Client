# Boost_Echo_Client
SPL3 client

Client Part of client-server project from the course "Systems Programming" of Ben-Gurion University.
The project was to build a "social network" using two kinds of server architectures: A. Thread Per Client (TPC) B. Reactor Server.

The Server (Both of them) is written in Java, and the Client side is written in C++ using Boost
